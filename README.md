Live version: https://chanarpeterson.github.io/Color-Game-Project/

This game is a spinoff on Colt Steele's Color Game project from Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp. 
Read the RGB value in the header and attempt to guess which color it corresponds to. Easy mode gives you the choice of three colors while hard (default) gives you the choice of six.

Happy clicking!
